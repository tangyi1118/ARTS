China unveils action plan to protect, restore Yangtze River

China has unveiled an action plan to protect and restore the Yangtze River as the country pushes forward environmental protection.  
Water quality of more than 85 percent of Yangtze River segments should reach Level III standard or above by the end of 2020, according to the plan released jointly by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment and National Development and Reform Commission.  
It also said more than 90 percent of "black and odorous" water bodies in cities at or above prefecture level in the Yangtze River economic belt should be eliminated by the end of 2020.  
Regions along the river in 11 provinces and municipalities are set as key areas, the plan said.  
It also listed eight major tasks on Yangtze River protection including strengthening industrial, agricultural and shipping pollution treatment, ensuring safety of drinking water source quality and cracking down on ecological destruction.  
The protection and renovation of the Yangtze River, the country's longest waterway, should combine water pollution treatment, water ecology restoration and water resources protection, the MEE said.  
China classifies water quality in major rivers and lakes into six levels, ranging from Level I, which is good enough to be used as the source of drinking water, to Level VI which is too polluted to be used even for farm irrigation.

中国出台措施保护并修复长江生态

为推进环境保护，中国出台保护和恢复长江的行动计划。  
根据生态环境部（？？？）和国家发展改革委员会联合发布的计划，2020年结束之前，长江中超过85%河段的水质应该达到或超过III级标准。  
该计划同时要求长江经济带的城乡中90%以上的黑臭水体都应当被清除。  
计划中，长江途经的11个省及直辖市被设置为关键区域。  
生态环境部表示，长江是我国最长的水道，长江的保护与整治应将水污染治理、水生态修复和水资源保护结合起来。  
我国将主要的江河湖泊的水质划分为六个等级，从Ⅰ级(水质好可以作为饮用水源)到Ⅳ级(污染太过严重甚至不能用于农业灌溉)。
