The average monthly salary of food couriers in China last year was 7,750 yuan ($1,141), even higher than some white-collar jobs, according to a report from the country's leading life services platform, 58.com.

The report released on Monday shows that food couriers in Hangzhou city of East China's Zhejiang province lead the way with a monthly salary of 9,121 yuan, followed by Beijing, Nanjing and Shanghai with 9,072 yuan, 8,728 yuan and 8,481 yuan, respectively.

Currently, the demand for food delivery workers exceeds the supply, and enterprises are eager to hire more. Food couriers are actually paid more than they expect, mainly because their overall income is higher than that of other occupations, such as administrative and clerical positions, the report said.

The report also shows that China's first-tier cities and new first-tier cities had the most demand for and supply of professional talents. The top 10 cities with the highest demand for delivery drivers are Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Chongqing, Nanjing, Wuhan, Hangzhou and Xi 'an.

The main reason is that people in these cities are busier and have a better sense of time, so they tend to choose convenient take-out food instead of cooking or eating out.

The number of delivery drivers is quite large in first - and second-tier cities, and has a trend of gradually covering third - and fourth-tier cities. Also, the food is delivered to more places, from residences and office buildings to hotels and hospitals.

A user on microblog Sina Weibo said, " How I envy them! I want to quit my job and be a food delivery worker", but some held a different view, that the delivery couriers work so hard to deliver packages every day.

根据国家主要的生活服务平台 58 同城报道，外卖员在去年每个月的平均工资在 7，750，甚至高过一些白领职业。

这个报道在星期一展示了杭州以北、浙江的外卖员一个月工资为9，121元，紧随其后的是北京、南京和上海，分别是9，072元、8，728元、和8，481元。

记者报道：现在，外卖员需求超过供给，企业热切希望招聘更多。外卖员能收到比他们预期更高的薪酬，主要是因为他们全部收入高过其他职业，类似行政和文书职位。

报道还展示了中国一线城市和新一线城市对提供专业人才有更多需求。对外卖员需求最高的前10位城市是北京、上海、深圳、广州、成都、重庆、南京、武汉、杭州和西安。

主要原因是在他们在他们城市是建设者和时间很宝贵，所以他们更倾向选择订外卖来代替煮饭或出去吃。

一线和二线的外卖员数量十分大，并逐渐覆盖三、四线城市。而且外卖可以送往更多地方。从住宅到办公处，旅馆到医院。

一个新浪微博的用户说：我多么羡慕他们啊！我想辞去我的工作成为一个外卖员。“但有些人持不同观点（但是也有一些不同的地方。）就是外卖工作者的工作是每天都要背着个包去送外卖，十分辛苦。
