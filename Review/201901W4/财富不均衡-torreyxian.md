The combined fortune of 26 of the world's richest people is equal to the total wealth of the 3.8 billion poorest people. This startling disparity in wealth is according to a report from the charity Oxfam. It reported that since the global financial crisis in 2008, the number of billionaires in the world has doubled. They are also getting $2.5 billion richer every day. This is in stark contrast to the world's less fortunate - the poorest half of the planet is seeing its wealth slowly shrink as prices of commodities increase, wages are squeezed and land prices and rents rise. Oxfam's report highlights the growing gap between the world's rich and poor and the ever-widening gap in wealth inequality.

The report says that most of the world's mega-wealthy have made their huge fortunes from technology companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook. The world's richest person is Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos. His amassed $100 billion fortune is 100 times greater than the annual health budget of Ethiopia. Oxfam said it was time to try and redress the imbalance in wealth. It recommended taxing income at fairer levels, increasing tax on personal earnings and corporate profits, and eliminating tax avoidance schemes commonly used by companies and the super-rich. It said: "In many countries, a decent education or quality healthcare has become a luxury only the rich can afford."

世界上最富裕的 26 个人的财富总和和 38 亿最贫穷的人口的财富相等。慈善机构乐施会的一份报告显示。自 2008 年的金融危机以来，全球亿万富翁人数翻了一番。他们的收入以每天 25 亿财富的速度增长。这与地球上最贫穷的一半人看到随着商品价格上涨，工资受到挤压以及土地和租金上涨，其财富会逐渐缩小形成鲜明对比。乐施会的报告强调了世界贫富差距与不断扩大的财富不平等差距。

这则报道称，世界上大多数超级富豪都从亚马逊，微软和 Facebook 这样的科技公司中获得巨额财富。世界上最富有的人是亚马逊创始人兼首席执行官杰夫贝索斯。他积累的 1000 亿美元财富是埃塞俄比亚年度医疗预算的 100 倍。乐施会表示，是时候尝试纠正财富的不平衡。它建议在较公平的水平上征税，增加个人收入和企业利润税，取消公司和超级富豪常用的避税计划。它说：在许多国家，体面的教育或优质的医疗保健已成为富人才能享有的。
